## Who am I?

I am a senior year undergrad student at University of Mumbai majoring in Computer Engineering.

I've been working with <em>Dr. Zeerak Talat</em> from the Digital Democracies Institute at <em>Simon Fraser University</em> for cross-dataset generalization in hate speech detection. We have also worked on emoji prediction in low resource languages.

I'm also a part of [Unicode Research Group](https://unicode-research.netlify.app/people/) led by <em>Swapneel Mehta (NYU CSMaP)</em> and mentored by <em>Dr. Akash Srivastava (MIT-IBM Lab)</em> where we're currently working on identifying mentorship effects in Indian institutions using Causal Inference. We have also recently started working on a simulator to model online communities in order to measure polarization on social networks.

<b>My current areas of interest include:</b>

<ul>
<li>Natural Language Processing</li>
<li>Computational Social Science</li>
<li>Information Retrieval</li>
<li>Social Networks</li>
</ul>

I was a Teaching Assistant for the [Unicode Machine Learning Summer Course 2021](https://djunicode.github.io/umlsc-2021/) supported by <b>Google Research India</b>.

In the past, I've worked as a Summer Intern in the Corporate and Investment Banking Department at JPMorgan Chase & Co. Before that, I was a Freelance Python Developer at <a href="http://www.margosatree.com">Margosatree Technologies </a>. I've also worked as a Machine Learning Engineer Intern at <a href="https://levyne.com">Levyne</a> and as a Data Analyst at <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/feopleorg/">Feople</a>.

Apart from coding, I spend my leisure time swimming, reading books, solving riddles and exploring some amazing offbeat places.
