  abstract  = "We propose a computationally efficient method to conduct sentiment analysis on Indic languages such as Hindi, Marathi, Bengali and Telugu. For this purpose, We propose Federated Learning as a solution to the fragmented datasets for resource-constrained languages. After conducting extensive experiments on iid and non-iid distributions of data, we found that the Federated models perform far better than the server based models. As per our knowledge, this was first of its kind work done to steer these low resource Indic languages towards Federated Learning",

  abstract = "Deep Learning, a branch of Machine Learning is a rapidly expanding field in the Industry 4.0 revolution. The number of applications of Deep Learning are enormous - finding multiple uses in a single domain. Deep Learning enhances current research and provides better perception to a wide spectrum of domains, including Music Information Retrieval. Music is an art, that is widely celebrated worldwide, with countless songs being released or published every day. Music can be classified into many 'genres'. A statistical study conducted in 2018 shows that there are more than 10 genres of music, with `Hip-Hop/Rap 'being the most with most music composed. When one decides to listen to music, one usually has a particular genre in mind, and expects the music application he or she is using to provide numerous songs falling in that genre. A good music application would not only provide many songs, but also increase the ease of access to a particular song or genre. Due to tremendous increase in the amount of digital data available on the internet, the task of accurately classifying music files has become a major problem for music applications like YouTube Music, iTunes or Spotify, which can be solved with the help of Deep Learning techniques. This paper includes an indepth comparison of four transfer learning architectures, i.e. Resnet34, Resnet50, VGG16 and AlexNet, which were the best performing models during different times in ImageNet, to accomplish the task of classification of different songs on the basis of their genre."

  abstract     = "Machine Translation, a widely known field in computer linguistics, is a challenging problem which deals with translating between different languages. We undertake the task of translating from Spanish to French in this paper. We provide a comparative analysis of various sequential and non-sequential models such as Seq2Seq, Seq2Seq with Teacher Forcing, Seq2Seq with attention, and Transformers with encoder-decoder architectures for the proposed task. Our experiments show that Transformer architecture along with Label Smoothing attains the best BLEU score on the UN dataset and it is the most efficient choice. Furthermore, we compare various decoding methods like Nucleus Sampling, Top-k sampling, and Greedy Approach, and also conduct an ablation analysis of each of these until we find the best performing method. Our proposed architecture combination is easily extensible and could be used for other translation tasks as well, with minor changes in the pre-processing steps depending upon the languages under consideration. This method is also computationally economic and might help under constrained environments.",
