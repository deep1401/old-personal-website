For this purpose, We propose Federated Learning as a solution to the fragmented datasets for resource-constrained languages. After conducting extensive experiments on iid and non-iid distributions of data, we found that the Federated models perform far better than the server based models. As per our knowledge, this was first of its kind work done to steer these low resource Indic languages towards Federated Learning",

  abstract = "Deep Learning, a branch of Machine Learning is a rapidly expanding field in the Industry 4.0 revolution. The number of applications of Deep Learning are enormous - finding multiple uses in a single domain. Deep Learning enhances current research and provides better perception to a wide spectrum of domains, including Music Information Retrieval. Music is an art, that is widely celebrated worldwide, with countless songs being released or published every day. Music can be classified into many 'genres'. A statistical study conducted in 2018 shows that there are more than 10 genres of music, with `Hip-Hop/Rap 'being the most with most music composed. When one decides to listen to music, one usually has a particular genre in mind, and expects the music application he or she is using to provide numerous songs falling in that genre. A good music application would not only provide many songs, but also increase the ease of access to a particular song or genre. Due to tremendous increase in the amount of digital data available on the internet, the task of accurately classifying music files has become a major problem for music applications like YouTube Music, iTunes or Spotify, which can be solved with the help of Deep Learning techniques. This paper includes an indepth comparison of four transfer learning architectures, i.e. Resnet34, Resnet50, VGG16 and AlexNet, which were the best performing models during different times in ImageNet, to accomplish the task of classification of different songs on the basis of their genre."

  abstract = "With groundbreaking innovations in healthcare due to advancements in machine learning and deep learning, the need for computationally efficient and privacy-preserving solutions is exigent. Modern healthcare systems collect healthcare data in huge volumes. However, this data resides in different locations and is held by different institutions. This hinders its utilization by machine learning algorithms since they require large data sets from training. Moreover, accessing sufficient data from varied data silos is not possible due to various constraints like ethical, legal, economic, and technical challenges. Since medical data is highly sensitive, privacy concerns assume paramount importance. While dealing with similar scenarios, Federated Learning has shown promising results and could also be used in the healthcare domain for solving these issues. To explore the feasibility of federated learning in medicine by facilitating multi-institutional collaborations, the problem of brain tumor segmentation is undertaken. With the help of federated learning, training of models collaboratively from multiple parties owning the data while keeping privacy in check can be achieved. An aggregate ensemble of four different segmentation U-Net models for Cloud-based horizontal federated learning architecture with a FedProx algorithm is suggested to tackle the problem. In order to locate the area where the tumor is present, an average of codes is considered after every result to form the end MRI. This approach brings the model to the sensitive data owners and requires only the model updates to be sent to the central server, thereby preventing leakage of data and preserving privacy. While doing so, faulty updates from malicious clients can be discarded, thereby preventing them from hindering the central model. The challenges and considerations that need to be addressed while dealing with healthcare data for brain tumor segmentation are also highlighted in the chapter."
